In computer programming, if we want to get the value of the remainder, we use the modulus operator, which in Quorum is: <b>mod</b>. So if we divide 10 by 3 using the division operator <b>(10 / 3)</b> we get 3. If we use the modulus operator instead <b>(10 mod 3)</b> we get the remainder 1. Write code to use these operators with <b>integer</b> variables. What will the modulus be if the numbers divide evenly?")
