In this case, students work on representing images using sampling. Students quickly realize that very tiny sample squares are needed to approximate an image's curves and small details. The smaller we make each sample, the more bits are needed. Students must also wrestle with deciding whether each square should be a 0 or 1, as many squares have both white and black in the same square. They will have more control over the representation of each bit in the next lesson.")
