The lesson ends with a discussion of the situations where lossless compression is important and the situations where lossy compression is important.")

A theme throughout the lesson is that lossy compression can greatly reduce the file size, but it can also greatly reduce the quality and it's important to find that balance between quality and file size. The real challenge here is finding where that line is - how much can we compress but still keep it recognizable? In the final discussion, students compare lossy compression with lossless compression to see that each has value depending on the situation - lossy is useful when file size needs to be minimized, but lossless is important when its vital to be able to reconstruct the original image.")
