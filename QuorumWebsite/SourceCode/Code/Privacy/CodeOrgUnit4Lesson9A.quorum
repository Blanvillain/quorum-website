        cryptography which is an answer to the crucial question: How can two people send encrypted messages 
        back and forth over insecure channels (the Internet) without meeting ahead of time to agree on a 
        secret key? In a nutshell, there are two main principles we want students to understand: 1) The 
        mechanics of communication with public key cryptography. 2) The basic mathematical principles that 
        make it possible. The lesson gets at these two core ideas through a deliberate chain of thought 
        experiments, demonstrations, activities, and widgets. All parts are building blocks that lead to 
        deeper understanding of how it works. ")
