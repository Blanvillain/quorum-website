        Read the definition at the beginning of the lesson again. It is 
        not a law of nature or mathematics but simply a surprisingly accurate 
        prediction that was made a long time ago. In 1965, a computer chip 
        designer named Gordon Moore predicted that the number of transistors
         one could fit on a chip would double every 18 months or so. Amazingly, 
        that prediction has more or less held true to the present day! The 
        result is that since about 1970, computers have gotten twice as fast, 
        at half the cost, roughly every 1.5-2 years. With some small differences, 
        the same is true for data storage capacity. This is extraordinarily 
        fast growth - which is called exponential growth. With more and more machines 
        that are faster and faster, the amount of data being pushed around, 
        saved, and processed is growing exponentially. This is so fast that 
        it's hard to fathom and even harder to plan for. Mention the following example: If the 
        average hard drive today is 1 TB and you are planning for something 
        or 6 years away, you should expect that average hard drives will be 
        8-10 TB. Keep in mind the following things about Moore's Law:")
