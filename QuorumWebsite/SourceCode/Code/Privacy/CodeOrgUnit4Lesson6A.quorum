            consumer concerns around apps and 
            websites that collect and track data about you in exchange 
            for providing you a service free of cost.
            Often the quality of the service itself is dependent on 
            having access to data about many people and 
            their behavior. The main take-away of the lesson is that 
            students should be more informed consumers 
            of the technology around them. They should be able to 
            explain some of the tradeoffs between

        the technology we use every day. This issue 
        goes beyond instances when data is stolen from companies

        to. Instead, using computational tools, our movements 
        through the physical and virtual world are 
        being automatically tracked, stored, and analyzed. 
        Cookies in our browsers keep a record of our 
        movements on the Internet. Companies trade access 
        to free tools and apps for the rights to track 
        the data we upload to them. Advertisers develop personalized 
        profiles of potential customers to 
        better target advertising. Governments monitor traffic 
        across the Internet at scales unimaginable 
        without the use of computers. Yet we live in a world 
        that increasingly relies on these digital 
        tools, services and products. Most companies make 
        great efforts to balance the tradeoffs between 
        utility and privacy, but the issues can be tricky 
        and raise confounding ethical dilemmas. We must 
        now grapple with a question of just how much we 
        value our privacy, and whether it is even possible 
        to maintain in a digitized world.")
