In the warm up students discuss which of a list of possible information types they consider private. Then students read the data policies from a website or service they use or know about. This investigation focuses on the kinds of data that are being collected, the way it's being used, and any potential privacy concerns that arise. A brief second activity reveals that even data that may not seem private, like a birthdate or zipcode, can be combined to uniquely identify them. To conclude the lesson students prepare for a discussion in the following class about the pros and cons of sharing all this data by journaling about their current thoughts on whether the harms of giving up this privacy are outweighed by the benefits of the technology they power.")
