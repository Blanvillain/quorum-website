Students should identify a particular property they want to train the computer on and should be encouraged to be creative with the properties they choose. One student might choose, for example, a visual property, like the color of a can, while another might choose to provide information to their machine via another sense (e.g., feeling for whether an item is a box or a can, weight). Once items are gathered, have the human student provide the items to the AI student in order and with a label (e.g., item 1, round). This human student should categorize them via the appropriate properties, marking each item with a number (e.g., item 1) and its property (e.g., it is round). Excel, paper, or any other mechanism is reasonable for doing this marking. The AI student should mark the labels down even if they are wrong.
