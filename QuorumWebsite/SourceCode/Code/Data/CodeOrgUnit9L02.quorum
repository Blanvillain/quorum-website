Accessible Data Science Libraries in Quorum to create two different kinds of charts: 1) a bar chart, 
and 2) a histogram. The lesson begins with a quick prompt to review the reasons charts are useful 
for looking at data. Students then practice reading a bar chart and review the kinds of questions 
it is and is not useful for answering. Afterwards they build different bar charts in Quorum and 
discuss why some are or are not useful. Afterwards they learn how to make histograms for building 
charts in instances where bar charts may not be useful. Students record their work on an activity 
guide. The lesson concludes with a brief review of what they learned.
