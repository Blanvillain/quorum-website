They build a small arrangement of blocks (e.g. LEGO&trade; pieces or paper cutouts) and then create text instructions a classmate could follow to construct the same arrangement. Groups then trade instructions to see if they were clear enough to allow reconstruction of the original arrangement. The wrap-up discussion is used to highlight the inherent ambiguities of human language and call out the need for the creation of a programming language which leaves no room for interpretation.")

We need to create more structured and precise programming languages in order to accomplish this.")
