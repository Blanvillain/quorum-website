As computational power and time have both progressed, standards have migrated to larger binary numbers, usually 64-bit, in order to accommodate changing demands of these systems. Moving all members of the computing community over to these new standards can take some time, however, as many users continue to expect to receive and send information using the older 32-bit protocol.")
