                    addresses in the previous lesson, you will simulate the Internet in groups that 
                    allow messages to be sent only to an intended recipient, as indicated by an IP address. 
                    This simulation will also allow you to examine the traffic that goes through all of the 
                    (simulated) routers on the network. You will notice that messages go through many different 
                    routers, may not always take the same path to reach the final destinaton, and that the routers 
                    (and their owners) can see all of this traffic!")

                    Simulating the router traffic provides a tool for students to discover the extra work that routers are doing to send messages - they can see that messages are passed between routers and that messages take different paths along the way.
                    Importantly, students should make a connection between these observations about multiple pathways and the concept of fault-tolerance - because there are multiple pathways, the internet can continue to function even when there may be an issue that the routers need to address.")
