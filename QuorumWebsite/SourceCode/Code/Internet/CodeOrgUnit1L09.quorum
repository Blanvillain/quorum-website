In this lesson, students are introduced to the concept of compression as a way to address the growing file sizes of all of our information. This lesson is anchored by the Text Compression widget, which is a very hands-on & active widget for students to experiment with. Most of the lesson should be spent in the widget, having students experiment with different strategies for compression and creating a memorable experience to help anchor the concept of compression. Students also watch a video that introduces <b>lossless</b> and <b>lossy compression</b> - today's lesson is an example of <b>lossless compression</b>, while tomorrow's lesson is dedicated to <b>lossy compression</b>. The widget is just one example of lossless compression and students aren't expected to master specific compression strategies - instead, they should understand that lossless compression uses less data and still lets them re-create the original information.")
