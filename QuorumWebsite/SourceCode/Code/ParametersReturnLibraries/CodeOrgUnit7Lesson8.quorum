This kind of thinking requires not only a mastery of programming concepts and skills, but the ability to think more abstractly about how programs are built. Students need to identify common situations or problems that they and other programmers may encounter, and help build commands to address that problem.")
        section_intro:AddParagraph("This project also caps off a unit that is all about abstraction. On one level students are thinking about procedural abstraction, and simply learning how to design functions. On another level, however, they're learning to think abstractly. They're not merely designing a function, but they're thinking about the entire process of how programs are developed and common problems or situations that arise. This mental approach to thinking about why to build a function is just as important as knowing the steps to design one.")
