            This action knows how to read a scene file, process the information inside of it, and load that information into an application. This example is the default that is placed into the blank scene template when creating a scene. 
            For this reason, running the default scene project automatically loads whatever scene was created and starts the game.")

            To run the scene, click the Green RUN arrow, or use COMMAND+R or CONTROL+R. The scene will run, and open a game window with the scene loaded.")
