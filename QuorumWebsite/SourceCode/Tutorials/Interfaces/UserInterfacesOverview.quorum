            discussing one of the more complex areas in computer science: how to 
            create Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). The topic of user interfaces is 
            complex, not just because it takes practice to learn how to program them, but 
            also because user interfaces are used by human beings, who may or may 
            not understand the intent of the programmer. During this overview, we will 
            provide some context for user interfaces. Once this overview is complete, 
            the next tutorials will go into the details for how we program them.")

            to understand when building user interfaces is that they are designed not 
            for a programmer, but for a human user. A button is made to be clicked, 
            a tree is made to be navigated, and a textbox is made for typing. 
            Each component has a different set of conventions that have been

            other tutorials before starting these. Notably, it's especially critical 
            to understand concepts like conditionals, loops, actions, and especially 
            classes. The user interface tutorials coming up all use these concepts
