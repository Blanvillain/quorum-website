Both software allow us to enter in data entries, perform calculations, and save files onto our computers. Sometimes, we find data sets we would like to use to examine such as making calculations or creating a chart. However, not all data sets come in the format of a CSV. Oftentimes, we may have to manually enter our data from two different parts or convert it from a plain excel file. We will go over how to actually export these datasets from Google Sheets and Excel.")
