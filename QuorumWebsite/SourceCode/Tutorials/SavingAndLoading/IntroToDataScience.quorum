In it, we discuss the major features, like loading data, analyzing it, and generating charts from it. The goal of this set of tutorials is practical in the sense that it provides how to use the libraries and interpret the results, but it is not intended as a fully data science curriculum or statistics tutorial. While some equations on how the system works will be included, the goal here is to describe how to use the system, not to provide a deep dive of the math. ")

        bodyDiv:AddParagraph("Thus, perhaps the first question to answer is what this set of tutorials are for, which in turn gets at what data science is for. In plain English, data science, statistics, and similar areas are designed to help us understand certain kinds of questions. Namely, we have a data set, in it is some kind of information structured in any way we can imagine, and the goal is to answer a question about that data. In a sense, we want to turn that data into information that we can practically use.")

There are many ways to load data and Quorum has adopted an "+dq+"opinionated"+dq+" approach, similar to TidyVerse in the language R. We did this in part because the approach is consistent in how it stores data, but also because using the same way of loading data across the board for all data sets makes analysis easier. To understand this, we first need to talk about data frames, which are basically fancy tables we can load from a spreadsheet.")
