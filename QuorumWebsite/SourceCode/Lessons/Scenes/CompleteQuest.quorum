Notably, you might consider writing code that changes the audio channel depending on the direction of an item or you could use spatialized sound to provide more information about the environment in general. Other accessibility features that could be built include using sounds to indicate if a character bumped into a wall or really anything. The point is to be creative and think about the following question: what would make this game more accessible, to whom, and how do we invent that?")
