        bodyDiv:AddParagraph("With scatter plots, you are often investigating the relationship between variables. Since how related variables are is an important factor for graphing, there are a couple of terms scientists use for thinking about them.")
        bodyDiv:AddParagraph("Firstly: correlation. Correlation is when variables are related to each other. Itï¿½s important to note that being related to each other doesnï¿½t necessarily mean one causes the other. For example, two people getting a storm alert warning may be correlated (since they might live in the same area impacted by the storm), but one of them getting that warning does not cause the other to get it. Correlation is important because, even if factors donï¿½t cause each other, they may both be caused by a third factor (in this case, the storm). If we understand which factors influence each other, then we can better understand how everything interacts.")
        bodyDiv:AddParagraph("Causation is when factors do cause each other, such as watering a plant causing it to grow. To prove causation, we have to actually do further experiments to prove it, since we canï¿½t tell that relationship from just a scatter plot.")
        bodyDiv:AddParagraph("Correlation can also be strong or weak. Strong correlation is when the data points are closer to the regression line, while weak correlation means theyï¿½re a bit more spread out. A positive correlation is when the increase of the independent variable means an increase in the dependent variable, so like an increase in age is related to an increase in height. The opposite is called a negative correlation, such as an increase in heat leads to a decrease in ice. ")    

        bodyDiv:AddHeading("R^2 (15 minutes)",2)

        bodyDiv:AddParagraph("Related to correlation is the term R^2. R^2 is basically how much the independent variable can explain a dependent variable. So, if we looked at something like age and height, it would be how much the changes in age can explain changes in height. While age and height are correlated, your height is also impacted by other factors, like how tall your parents are, and so not all height variation can be explained by age. However, if I had a more theoretical model where y = 2x, then y could be fully explained by what x is. ")
        bodyDiv:AddParagraph("R^2 is between 0 and 1, with 0 meaning the independent variable explains none of the dependent variableï¿½s change, and 1 meaning it explains all of it. Since most real-world data usually has multiple influences on each point, itï¿½s unlikely R^2 would actually be 1. ")
        bodyDiv:AddParagraph("It is possible to use regression lines, like the one we drew earlier, to actually calculate R^2, although we wonï¿½t be getting into that today. However, we will be looking at roughly different strengths of R^2. ")
        bodyDiv:AddParagraph("If we look at our current chart from before, we can tell thereï¿½s a weak correlation between BMI and Insurance Cost. This means R^2 will be in the middling range. If we add age as a column instead of Insurance Cost, we can tell that thereï¿½s not really any correlation there, and so R^2 will be closer to 0. If we try Charges vs Age, we can see a weaker correlation than that between BMI and Insurance, with a slight upward trend but very spread out data. R^2 here would be slightly better than Age vs Insurance, but worse than BMI vs Insurance.")
