As a first version, add a header row to the top row of the spreadsheet with at least two columns. In each column, add numbers of your choosing to each column. The goal here is not to use real data, but to make sure we understand the relationship between what we type in the spreadsheet and what a spreadsheet application puts on our hard drive. Once we are happy with our spreadsheet, save it as a CSV file and open the file it made in a text editor and look at it. This is what Quorum will load when you write programs.
