When it began, Quorum was used exclusively at schools for the blind or visually impaired. 
Today, however, there is a diverse set of people using Quorum in the classroom, 
and likely for other purposes that we do not know. This list is not intended to be 
complete. It is just a sampling of the people that were kind enough to tell us they 
were using, or planning to use, Quorum in the classroom. In short, as of 2016, while Quorum 
has been downloaded all over the world, we can confirm courses are taught largely in the U.S.
The majority of schools are now mainstream, but we maintain healthy relationships 
with residential schools for the blind or visually impaired as well.")
