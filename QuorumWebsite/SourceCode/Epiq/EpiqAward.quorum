            early member of the steering committee that contributed significantly 
            to the development of the conference. It is now given annually to a 
            member, or members, of the committee that has contributed to the 
            community in some particularly epiq way. To be eligible, a participant must 
            be accepted to EPIQ and attend. From there, members submit 
            their materials to the award chair of the Steering Committee.")

            by several members of the steering committee, all subsequent awards have been 
            given by popular vote. For EPIQ 2017, there are two awards: 1) EPIQ Programming, and 
            2) EPIQ Teaching to honor both contributions. Multiple members of the community may team up to try
            and win either award, but only one trophy is given for a team. As always, 
            the EPIQ award is intended to be a fun activity for all members.")
