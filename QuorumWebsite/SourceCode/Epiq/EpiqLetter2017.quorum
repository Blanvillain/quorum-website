This organization works with several others that have helped with funding over the years, including the Washington State School for the Blind, Perkins School for the Blind, the Readers Digest Partners for Sight Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the University of Washington's Do-It program, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, the University of Alabama in Huntsville, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, AccessCS10k, and others.")

First, we will be hosting in a new location: The birthplace of modern Astrophysics: Yerkes Observatory in Williams Bay Wisconsin. We’ll have access to telescopes from around the world through the Skynet Robotic Telescope Network and use the Skynet Junior Scholars web portal to teach astronomy using accessible tools we’ve developed using the Quorum language. Second, we’ve partnered with the Wisconsin Center for the Blind and Visually impaired to provide participants with housing and meals at their wonderful campus in Janesville. Finally, we’ve adjusted the schedule to provide time each day after lunch for participants to get extra help in open labs, work on team projects for the EPIQ award, and attend special lectures on participant selected topics.")

        bodyDiv:AddParagraph("Attendees can choose between a beginner or advanced track and will spend the week learning how to use the accessible Integrated Development Environment Sodbeans and the Quorum Programing Language or a new version with chromebook support. The beginner track welcomes teachers that have little or no programming experience, while the advanced track will cover concepts up to and beyond a second semester college course. Both tracks contain new content and teach computer science concepts in the context of programming for mobile phones, 3D and 2D computer games, LEGO robotics, or auditory processing and gaming.  As usual, the programming environments are designed to be understandable and usable by all, including those with disabilities.")

To win this award, a participant demos their best program to the EPIQ community (e.g., games, robot demos). Second, there will be an EPIQ lesson award. To win this award, participants write up and present a lesson that can be used by teachers in the Quorum community. The winners are selected by popular vote of the community, will be provided a trophy, and will have their work highlighted on the website with past award winners. More information can be found at the EPIQ awards site: https://quorumlanguage.com/awards.html")

        bodyDiv:AddParagraph("We’ve been working with our partners and financial supporters to offer conference registration for $350.00, which up to our space limit will include housing and two meals. Scholarships will be available for travel reimbursement, housing past our space limit, and conference registration, however funding is limited and will be applied based on need and your application information. In previous years, we have been able to offer attendance at no charge, but the move of EPIQ to a new venue comes with some additional costs to run it in practice. We strongly encourage those teachers that cannot obtain support from their institutions to attend to apply for a reimbursement scholarship for registration or travel. Registration is tax-deductible through the Quorum Outreach and Research Foundation.")
